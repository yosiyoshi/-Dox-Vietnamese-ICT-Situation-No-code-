According to CEO of Cốc Cốc:

## ≪ AI, transparency and digital platform change future of industry... ≫

December 20, 2017 in Hanoi is the day of "Cốc Cốc's Hitech-Wednesday," to discuss design of computer science. Mr.Victor Lavrenko , co-founder of Cốc Cốc, presented "Trend of technological application in Vietnam," and especially mentioned 3 trends: AI, Transparently Immersive Experiences, and Digital Platform.

After that, Huyền Chíp from Stanford University presented "Computer Science Training" from the point of view: Vietnam vs Computer Science, as shown through her slide. From the experience through the study program of Stanford in Silicon Valley, she emphasized the importance of Computer Science. According to her, CS in Vietnam is still "minority" compared to the situation in the US. At Stanford University, over 90% of students take a CS course. In contrast, a quick survey of Cốc Cốc showed that 34.27% of students said that CS was "not very important" while only 16.3% said CS was important.

Although not small number of Vietnamese students succeed in finding a job for ICT industry, even for Google, a US-based ICT giant, but the academic environment for CS research is not enough good.
