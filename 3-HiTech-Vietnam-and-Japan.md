As I've already explained in past two articles before, Vietnam also has ambition to build their own aerospace industry.
Japan sent engineers to Vietnam for 5 years since 2013 untill 2017 in the field of aerospace development cooperation.
Vietnamese finished post-construction tests and are now verifying safety with them.

For the space flight, Micro Dragon's mission is to research ocean to evaluate water quality. The size is 50*50*50 cm3 and this satellite is expected to contribute to the development of ocean industry in Vietnam.
It's a artificial satellite made in Vietnam with engineering safety design based on itinerary(in another word, blueprint) of VietNam Space Center(VNSC; Trung tâm Vũ trụ Việt Nam). In August 2013, construction of satellite Pico Dragon was completed by VNSC engineers getteing cooperation with University of Tokyo,
and succeeded launching with loaded on Kounotori in Tanegashima, Japan. This Micro Dragon is the successor of Pico Dragon and is to be launched by Japanese Epsilon rocket in 2018.
As the series of satellites made-in-Vietnam, "Nano Dragon" is planned in 2016, and LOTUSat-2 in 2020 to be launched.

Therefore, we could observe the progress in Foreign-Vietnamese partnership in the future carefully.
