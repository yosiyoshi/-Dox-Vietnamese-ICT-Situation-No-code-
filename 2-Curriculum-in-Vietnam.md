About 60% of Vietnamese schools choose "Java" as the (primary) educational language. And also recognize it as the most dificult language for beginners.
Since Mecon delta region got cooperation by Google and MIT in 2018, elementary schools in southern Vietnam introduced Scratch for Industry 4.0, an emerging tide globally.


### Comparison with Indonesia, how Vietnam makes diffirent?

QĐ-ĐHQGHN, as known as Vietnam National University Hanoi is a leading university in Vietnam. ICT curriculum is officially listed in 2012, and now each class has 80 students to study ICT technologies.
Compared to Indonesia, VNU has unique "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Data mining", and "Robotics" class to aim "Cách Mạng Công nghiệp 4.0 (CMCN 4.0)", in other word, Industry 4.0 .


In addition, however, although VNU hasn't Java class which taught widely in Vietnam, but has C/C++ and Python same as Universitas Indonesia, and also C#(Used in Unity), and Perl.
Found Linux class as an independent class, so I think they use Windows or macOS in their daily class.


The feature of Vietnamese curriculum is that they teach not only programming for PC and Smartphone, but also for AI and robotics. I analyse this point is how Vietnam constantly educate high quality programmers.
