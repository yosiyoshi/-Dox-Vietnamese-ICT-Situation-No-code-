## Deep Learning Lectures in University: Case from Ton Duc Thang University and FPT University
(Vietnamese: TRƯỜNG ĐẠI HỌC TÔN ĐỨC THẮNG, and TRƯỜNG ĐẠI HỌC FPT)

### Case from Ton Duc Thang University(TDTU)
Based on the information according to syllabus for faculty of IT in TDTU, 2017-2018. We can find several classes are available for study Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Using Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Theano, Panda, Matlab etc. In general, TDTU students can study basic technique of C++, Java, Python, HTML, PHP, and Ruby sometimes with using iOS and network environment practically.
Rasberry Pi, a popular material to study IoT through practice of using Python, is also included. Security and cloud server technologies studied in this campus, are also can be applied with Deep Learning techniques, as known as cloud security.
(As seen in thesis e.g. "DeepSecure" [BD Rouhani et al., UCSD])

Through collaboration with foreign countries(such as Japan), and including "off-shore development" contracts, Vietnam developed their software industry of high level.
At least, Japanese IT firms are interested in collaborating with and recruiting students from outstanding universities such as Hanoi University of Science and Technology etc.

The contents of Deep Learning study curriculum taught in TDTU is mainly about LSTM, CNN, and RNN. The application is about ImageNet, Pixel CNN/RNN, G-CNN, GANs, FlowNet, Super Resolution, NLP (English Natural Language Processing).
Out of DL field, but traditional stastic EN-VN translation is also available.

Thus we might read Vietnamese syllabus from the point of view in Deep Learning.

### Case form FPT University(FPTU)

Based on the infromation according to FPTU official website: http://daihoc.fpt.edu.vn/ai-nganh-chuyen-sau-sieu-hot-trong-thoi-ky-cm-4-0/
As Nanjing University is to set up an artificial intelligence (AI) R&D center announced in China where "China 2025 plan" is ongoing, 2018, Vietnam is also improving international-partnerships (especially with Japan) to improve "CM 4.0 (Revolution 4.0)" plan.
FPT University, an outstandign private university in ICT field, opened their new AI major course as was done by Nanjing University.
